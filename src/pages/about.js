          well, you might already know my name (I am assuming it because it is
          right inside the header of my homepage with bold and overwhelmingly
          large font size, even a blind person could see this).
        </p>
        <p>
          OK, sorry for that (Actually, I am terrible at writing. So filling out
          the <b>"About"</b> page with absolute sh!t).
        </p>
        <h2>Lets start!</h2>
        <p>I am a self taught full stack developer.</p>
        <p>
          Started my journey of coding around the mid of 2017 and enjoying the
          ride so far.

          <b>Favourite language:</b> Python || Javascript (not sure, which one)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Favourite stack:</b> MERN (Node, React and Mongo fanboy)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hobbies:</b> 404 Not Found (no, seriously!! I really don't have any
          hobbies)
        </p>
        <p>
          OK, that is it. Don't ask me how I wrote that much <s>content</s>
          (sh!t) on my <b>"About"</b> page. But still, if you do, the obvious
          answer would be:- <b>I HAVE NOOOOOOOOO IDEA!!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Want to say hi, don't you even think about finding me on social media.
